Near Public Domain
==================

*What could humanity achieve whilst waiting for movies to fall into the public domain?*

A work in progress side project to show how insane copyright has become and how distant the public domain is from receiving any of history's greatest films.

Featuring:

+ Movie information from [themoviedb.org](http://www.themoviedb.org/)
+ [Bootstrap based](twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) web design that's mobile friendly
+ Handlebars + jQuery for interaction (TODO: replace with Ember.js)
+ Nothing too special
